# Logr

Some different implementations of the
[go-logr/logr](https://github.com/go-logr/logr) logging interface.

Currently there's only a *standard* implementation ([stdlogr](stdlogr)) using
`fmt` that prints logs to `STDOUT` in
[logfmt](http://godoc.org/github.com/kr/logfmt).

## stdlogr

The `stdlogr` uses `fmt` to print logs to `STDOUT` in
[logfmt](http://godoc.org/github.com/kr/logfmt). Error logs get printed even
if the `InfoLogger` is disabled.

Example:

```
package main

import (
  "errors"

  "github.com/activeshadow/logr/stdlogr"
)

func main() {
  // Create new "foo" logger that's enabled and has a verbosity level of 1.
  logger := stdlogr.New("foo", true, 1)
  logger.Info("is this working?", "working", true)

  foobarLogger := logger.WithName("bar")
  err := errors.New("this is an error")
  foobarLogger.Error(err, "what about this logger?", "hello", "world!")

  logger.V(1).Info("verbosity 1 log")
  logger.V(2).Info("verbosity 2 log")
}
```

Output:

```
level=info ts=1534767423 name=foo msg="is this working?" working=true
level=error ts=1534767423 name=foo.bar msg="what about this logger?" hello=world! error="this is an error"
level=info ts=1534767423 name=foo msg="verbosity 1 log" v=1
```
